# mingw-w64-qt4
Files are a copy of https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages-dev/tree/master/mingw-w64-qt4

I reproduce here this legacy mingw-w64 package which is still currently used in TeXmacs for windows
but no longer available readily built in the [msys2 repo](http://repo.msys2.org/mingw/i686/).
Unfortunately, building the package anew also fails with the current msys2...

In the release, I provide the last i686 binary (32bit) that was in the repo and that is needed for building TeXmacs.
